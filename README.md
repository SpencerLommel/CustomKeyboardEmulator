# CustomKeyboardEmulator

This is a library written in Python that allows you to define custom keyboard types with different keys and spacing.
It also allows you to emulate the keyboard on screen to see what it would look like

## Keyboard Layout Editor integration

This library will also support parsing [keyboard-layout-editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) data files 
so you can import/modify/export these files, and they work correctly with KLE data

## Test coverage

I mostly started this project to teach myself PyTest and get better at using Type Hinting and Python Best practices!
Because of this I am going to try and have 100% code coverage if possible =D

If you are a better Python programmer than me, please feel free to review my code and either open an issue or send me 
an email with how I can improve my library!

# Demo

Once I get finish the core part of this library I will add a demo here!
